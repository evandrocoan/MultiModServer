// Use this file to block SuperHero from giving weapons by map. This only blocks shmod from giving weapons.
// For example you can block all heroes from giving any weapon on all ka_ maps instead of disabling the hero.
// You can even force people to buy weapons for all maps by blocking all weapons on all maps.
//
// Usage for maps:
// - The asterisk * symbol will act as wildcard or by itself will be all maps, ie de_* is all maps that start with de_
// - If setting a map prefix with wildcard and setting a map that has the same prefix, place map name before the
//     prefix is used to use it over the prefix. ie set de_dust before de_* to use de_dust over the de_* config.
// Usage for weapon:
// - Place available weapon shorthand names from list below inside quotes and separate by commas.
// - Works like an on/off switch so if you set a weapon twice it will block then unblock it.
// - A special "all" shorthand name can be used to toggle all weapons at once.
// Valid shorthand weapon names:
// - all, p228, scout, hegrenade, xm1014, c4, mac10, aug, smokegrenade, elite, fiveseven, ump45, sg550, galil,
// - famas, usp, glock18, awp, mp5navy, m249, m3, m4a1, tmp, g3sg1, flashbang, deagle, sg552, ak47, knife, p90
//
// Examples of proper usage are as follows (these can be used by removing the // from the line):
// - below blocks sh from giving the awp and p90 on de_dust.
//de_dust "awp, p90"
// - below blocks sh from giving all weapons on all ka_ maps.
//ka_* "all"
// - below blocks sh from giving all weapons then unblocks hegrenade on all he_ maps.
//he_* "all, hegrenade"
