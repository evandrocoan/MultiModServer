botman's Monster plugin (http://planethalflife.com/botman)

06/30/2002 - Release 3.00.00
- You can now manually spawn monsters with the "monster" command even if
  the monster_spawn cvar is set to 0.
- Added dynamic precaching.  Precached sounds will only done for monsters
  that are specified in the map specific monster .cfg file or for monsters
  that are specified in the "monster_precache.cfg" file.  This helps prevent
  the error "S_Findname: Out of sfx_t" that clients will sometimes get when
  too many sounds have been precached.
- Added monster "bigmomma" (the big spider thing with the sack hanging down).

06/17/2002 - Release 2.10.00
- Fix bug where players weren't getting damaged by monsters.

06/16/2002 - Release 2.00.00
- Fixed Linux .cfg file parsing for MS-DOS formatted files (invalid monster
  name: monster/xxxxxxxx^M).
- Created monster_spawn CVAR to turn on/off monster spawning on the fly
  ("monster_spawn 1" is on, the default.  "monster_spawn 0" is off).
- Added support for monster_skill.cfg file (in the MOD directory).
- Created "monster" server command to allow server operators to spawn
  monsters next to players in the game.
- Added new monster "controller" (the flying head that shoots energy balls).
- Modified to support metamod "unload" plugin command.  Loading the
  plugin again after unloading it still doesn't seem to work.
- Fixed bug where monster gets double damage.  (Thanks hullu!)
