Waypoints by SoUlFaThEr for PODbot2.6mm(a metamod plugin).

Place all .pwf files in your "addons\podbot\WPTDefault" folder.

If you are playing this bot on CS 1.6 Steam.......you will need to NOT add 4 files to 
the WPTDefault folder:
de_aztec.pwf, de_cbble.pwf, de_inferno.pwf, and de_piranesi.pwf because these only 
work for CS 1.5.

The files named de_aztec(CS 1.6).pwf, de_cbble(CS 1.6).pwf, de_inferno(CS 1.6).pwf, and 
de_piranesi(CS 1.6).pwf...are the ones you need for Steam. These maps were changed!!!!!

You will need to rename these, taking out the (CS 1.6)..once that is done,
all maps will work with the waypoints given.

Have fun.
