//Flag placement
//Once you load a map, both flags will spawn at the first player's spawn point.
//As an RCON access admin you can move the flag bases to more suitable and ballanced places, you can do that using these commands in-game:
//
//ctf_moveflag red/blue - move flag's base to your position, works even if you're dead or spectating
//ctf_save - saves the flag base positions (as cstrike/maps/<mapname>.ctf)
//
//Optionally, you can also download the jctf_mapflags.zip for some flag positions made by me, extract in server's cstrike/maps folder.
