The original plugin "[URL="https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?t=77391"]Galileo[/URL]" is written by [B]Brad[/B]. The "Galileo 1.2" works similarly as the original
"[B]Galileo[/B]". But "[B][COLOR="Blue"]Galileo 1.2[/COLOR][/B]" has special features for the "[URL="https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?t=273020"]Multi-Mod Manager[/URL]" plugin, but it 
still can be used alone. See the [goanchor=Change]Change Log[/goanchor] and [goanchor=Credits]Credits[/goanchor] for more info.
