<p class="head">I.  Downloading<a name="dl"></a></p>
<p class="indent">You can always find the latest version of CSDM as a package at the <a href="http://www.bailopan.net/csdm/">CSDM Homepage</a>.
<p class="indent">The source code is available in full in its <a href="http://svn.alliedmods.net/viewvc.cgi/amxmodx/csdm_amxx/?root=dvander">SVN Repository</a>.
</p>
<p class="head">II. Installing<A name=install></A></p>
<p class="indent">CSDM Mod requires <a href="http://www.amxmodx.org/">AMX Mod X 1.75</a> or higher. Most plugins will require the Engine and CSTRIKE modules enabled. It was designed to run on Counter-Strike and will not work on any other mod (except  Condition Zero).
<p class="indent">To install the mod, follow these directions:
<ol>
     <li>Extract the CSDM package to your addons/amxmodx folder, or extract it locally for upload to FTP.</li>
     <li>Open addons/amxmodx/configs/plugins-csdm.ini file and enable/disable the plugins you want.</li>
     <li>Open addons/amxmodx/configs/csdm.cfg and configure CSDM to your liking.</li>
     <li>Restart your HLDS server, and you're done!</li>
</ol>
<p class="head">III. Configuration<A name=howto></A></P>
<p class="indent">Configuration is done entirely through the csdm.cfg file in amxmodx/configs.  <b>These values are NOT cvars!</b>  The csdm.cfg file is a special file that is read and parsed separately so multiple plugins can easily see values in it.  Each value is explained either in the csdm.cfg file or in the documentation provided by the respective plugin.</p>
<p class="head">IV. Commands<A name=cmds></A>

CSDM also defines two publically cvars: csdm_active (sets whether CSDM is enabled, also can be set by admins), and csdm_version (the CSDM version).  Lastly, there is a public "csdm" command that displays credits.
<br />
<p class="head">V. Developing/Coding<A name=dev></A></P>
<p class="indent">CSDM 2.1 is modular.  The base portion is a module built to handle and capture primitive events, as well as express things which would be computationally expensive as a plugin.  It is optimized for efficiency. </p>
<p class="indent">The idea behind CSDM 2.1 is rather than including every portion in one plugin, developers can write simple addons, using the basic events provided by the module.  This way using other modules or expensive parsing is often not necessary.  For a full reference of CSDM 2.0's API, you should see csdm.inc in the scripting/include folder of the CSDM download, or view it on SVN: <a href="http://svn.alliedmods.net/viewvc.cgi/amxmodx/csdm_amxx/scripting/include/csdm.inc?revision=371&root=dvander&view=markup" target="_blank">csdm.inc</a>.  A good example of a simple plugin using the API is csdm_tickets.sma.</p>
<p class="indent">The module automatically respawns players whenever a player joins, a round restarts, or a player dies.  The spawn events allow plugins to interrupt or hook various importat stages in a player's death/revival.  The module makes no attempt to spawn players in a certain location, it simply revives them.  Instead, it allows "spawn handlers" to attach.  The current spawn style handler (set by csdm_main) is notified when it can relocate a player.</p>
<p class="ident">The module handles the following things, notifying plugins:
<ul>
 <li>Round restarts</li>
 <li>Player deaths (you can block respawning)</li>
 <li>Player spawns (both "fake" and "real")</li>
 <li>Configuration file settings</li>
</ul></p>
<p class="indent">Lastly, the module also contains fast routines for common things, such as setting/retrieving player positions, respawning players through the CSDM interface, and removing weapons from the world or players.</p>
