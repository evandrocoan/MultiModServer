<b>Basics</b><br>
A small group of Traitors are randomly picked<br>
Together they have to kill all the Innocent<br>
The Innocent do not know who is a Traitor and who isn't<br>
<b>Special Equipment</b><br>
Traitors and Innocents who were selected as Detectives can buy special equipment<br>
Equipment Menu can be opened by writing /buy or pressing buy commands<br>
<b>Tips</b><br>
As Innocent, do not kill too easily! Killing or damaging teammate costs you Karma<br>
As Traitor, communicate and cooperate! Cause distractions, lead targets into traps<br>
As Detective, search bodies! All Innocents can see and use the results you find<br>
<b>Karma</b><br>
Your Karma goes down if kill or damage teammates<br>
It goes down less if their Karma is lower<br>
You get damage penalty based on your karma<br>
By playing clean rounds where you don't harm teammates, you regain Karma<br>
The Karma value shown on the scoreboard updates only after the round ends<br>
